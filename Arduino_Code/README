In this section is possible to finde the arduino code for the HackPad.
Before start uploading the HackPad, you need to know:
The code use all the memory availbale of the Arduino Pro Micro. 
To reduce the size of the code, I've decide to store all the words used for the display, in the internal EEPROM of the Arduino. 
To allow that we need (only for the first boot) to initialize the Arduino board and also the exernal EEPROM that contain our settings with a specific Arduino code.

and you need to follow these steps:

- install the Arduino version 1.8...
- install the Arduino library,
- install the Arduino board library (Arduino Pro Micro without the bootloader)
- upload the EEPROM intitalization Arduino code prepare the device.
- upload via programmer (with the help of an Arduino UNO) the HackPad code.
